Still going with the Farmhouse Favourites’ pay-as-you-go, home deliveries every Monday... 
Traditional tin loaves, free range eggs, organic, full cream milk AND its #ChelseaBun week this week too! I love it when I turn them out and all the caramelised butter runs down the sides..

Chocolate babka in #ElBarrio.

#Baking with chocolate is chaotic and messy. You can't stop it, you can only hope to contain it. A vessel can do it; so can technique. I used the #chelseabun method.

#NYC is reopening—it's too late to buy a high-walled loaf pan.
