Still going with the Farmhouse Favourites’ pay-as-you-go, home deliveries every Monday... 
Traditional tin loaves, free range eggs, organic, full cream milk AND its #ChelseaBun week this week too! I love it when I turn them out and all the caramelised butter runs down the sides..

With grumbling tummies, we are sad to hear that the #ChelseaBun on Limerston Street will be closing its doors forevermore today. The Chelsea Bun has satisfied local gluttony for over three decades and its fabulous breakfasts will be sorely missed by #ChelseaReach residents!
